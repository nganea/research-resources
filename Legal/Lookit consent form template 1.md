# Consent to participate in non-biomedical research: `Speech Matching`

Researchers led by `Dr. David Lewkowicz` at `Haskins Laboratories, Yale University` are running this study, "`Speech Matching`", on Lookit.

## Purpose

`When a baby hears someone talking, how do they know who is talking? In a busy playground or on the street, we often hear multiple people speaking at the same time. Adults have an easy time detecting who is talking, however we do not know whether this is also the case for babies. In this study, we are investigating the speech properties that babies use to figure out who is talking. This study will help us understand: (1) at what age babies are able to detect the correct speaker, and (2) whether babies use prior knowledge about how faces and voice are associated to detect the correct speaker.`

## Procedures

This study takes about `6 minutes` to complete. `Your baby will see two side-by-side
faces saying, “Hello baby!” or “Good job!”. Only one of the faces speaks in synchrony with the voice. We are interested in knowing whether your baby prefers one of the faces, hence we are measuring how long babies look at each face. We will ask you (the parent) to either place your baby in a highchair or a stroller so that you do not interfere with the quality of the data. Once the study begins, there is nothing you have to do other than let the videos play while your baby watches.`

## Participation

You and your child are free to choose whether to be in this study. If you and your child choose to participate, it's okay to stop at any point during the session. Please do pause or stop the session if your child becomes very fussy or does not want to participate! If this is a study with multiple sessions, it's okay not to complete all the sessions.

## Payment

`Families will receive a $5 Amazon gift card for every child who participates in the study and is in the age range specified above. You will receive your gift card by email within one week of participation.`

## Data collection and webcam recording

During the session, you and your child will be recorded via your computer's webcam and microphone. Video recordings and other data you enter are sent securely to our lab. At the end of the session, you will be prompted to choose a privacy level for your webcam recordings. You will have the option to withdraw your video data at this point. 

Data is stored securely on Lookit servers and by researchers. However, there is always a small risk that data transmitted over the internet may be intercepted or that the security of stored data may be compromised.

No video clips will be published or shared unless you allow this when selecting a privacy level. If we do not receive a consent recording (the video you'll make to the right) for this session and cannot verify that you agreed to participate, no other video from your session will be viewed.

## Use of data by study researchers

The research group led by `Dr. David Lewkowicz ` at `Haskins Laboratories, Yale University` will have access to video and other data collected during this session. We will also have access to your account profile, demographic survey, and the child profile for the child who is participating, including changes you make in the future to any of this information. We may study your child's responses in connection with his or her previous responses to this or other studies run by our group, siblings' responses to this or other studies run by our group, or demographic survey responses.

## Use of data by Lookit 

Because this study is being run on the Lookit platform, researchers working on the Lookit project at MIT will also have access to the data collected during this session, in addition to your account data, child profiles, and demographic survey responses. This data may be used by Lookit to detect and fix technical problems or identify new features that would be helpful; provide support to study researchers; assess data quality (for instance, how well an observer can tell which direction children are looking); evaluate the site's success in reaching a diverse population; and characterize family engagement (for instance, looking at what aspects of a study make parents more interested in coming back later).

## Publication of results

The results of the research may be presented at scientific meetings or published in scientific journals. Raw data (for instance, looking times to the left and right of the screen) may be published when it cannot identify children. We never publish children's birthdates or names, and we never publish your demographic data in conjunction with your child's video.

## Rights of research subjects

`If you have any questions concerning your rights as a research subject, you may contact the Human Investigation Committee at Yale University at (203) 785-4688. If after you have verbally consented to this form you have any questions about your privacy rights, please contact the Yale Privacy Officer at (203) 436-3650.`

## Researcher contact information
